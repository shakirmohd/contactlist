# Contact List Application

This is a Contact List application built using React and Redux. The application supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for contacts and includes a dark/light mode toggle and search functionality. Users can add both business and personal contacts, specifying their name, email, phone number, and contact type (business or personal). The app keeps track of the number of male and female contacts, as well as the number of personal and business contacts, and displays this information on the UI. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with clear labels and appropriate validation messages.
